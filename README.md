1. Git
- Install git.
https://git-scm.com/downloads

- You may see references to the stand alone app for git on your desktop. That's not what we're using for this course.

- Watch the videos in this series that you need to watch (seriously, even if you've been working with git for a while, it's sometimes handy to revisit, e.g., the difference between git and Github). They are on youtube. If you don't have a subscription, it will pop up with short ads. Sorry, but these are really decent videos. There's about 30 min total.
