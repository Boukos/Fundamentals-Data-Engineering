## Assignment 01: Set up and prerequisites

1. Git
- The following will get you through installing and starting with git.

- Watch the videos in this series that you need to watch (seriously, even if you've been working with git for a while, it's sometimes handy to revisit, e.g., the difference between git and Github). They are on youtube. If you don't have a subscription, it will pop up with short ads. Sorry, but these are really decent videos. There's about 30 min total.

- Follow the instructions to do what the videos walk you through. In installing git on your machine (if you don't have it), pay attention to the instructions to not use the stand alone app for git, but to work from the command line. This will help you become familiar with the command line and it really is easier.
